0.0.11

# When a PR is merged to default branch, changes to this file will trigger:
#
#  (1) a release to PyPI with the version listed on the first line above,
#      and then,
#
#  (2) tag the PR commit with the version.
#
#      Note on tags:
#      - The original ML Flow project uses tags like 'v1.2.3' to
#        mark releases.
#      - These tags have not been removed form the static UI repo fork.
#      - To distinguish static-ui releases we use tags with format
#        'static-v1.2.3' to mark commits that have been released.
